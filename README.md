MOB programming: any more than two people

# The Dev Workflow

* Understand the problem
* Plan first
  - Write a function that accepts two parameters and sums them.
    - write a function that accepts two parameters
    - check that the parameters are numbers
    - create a new variable that will hold the sum of the numbers
    - return that variable
* Google 
* Don't copy and paste
* `console.log`
* Use the node repl
* Errors are you friend
* Clean your code and use functions
  - reusable
  - make it more readable
  - use linter
  - remove duplication (DRY)
  - name you're things well
* Try stuff and see what happens

## Lectures

* learn new concepts
* introduce a new concept
* back filling / solidify concepts
* seeing how a professional dev approaches a problem or code.
* don't copy my code.
